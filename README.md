# Task 1: Waterfall vs Agile

Before beginning the project, the executive team wants to understand whether to use the Waterfall or the Agile methodology approach. They have asked you to do a comparative analysis of the two methodologies. What are the strengths and weaknesses of each approach? What kind of projects will benefit from one or the other of the approaches?  

Your deliverable for this task is a presentation with succinct analysis of pros and cons of the two methodologies

# Task 2 : User Stories

To identify 3 - 5 user stories for the new Interplanetary Video-Conferencing application.

# Task 3 : Role Assignments and Ceremonies

In this task, in preparation for the project you need to explain to the rest of the team role assignments and ceremonies in Scrum. In particular, you need to define the following:

Role Assignments describe what the responsibilities are for each role.  

Product Owner
Scrum Master
Development Team
Ceremonies describe who needs to attend, when the event happens, how long the event takes, if it's a recurring event and what the purpose is.

Sprint Planning
Daily stand-up
Sprint Review
Sprint Retrospective
Your deliverable for this task is a 1-2 page document explaining the role assignment and ceremonies in Scrum. 

# Task 4 :  Agile Tools and Concepts

We are getting ready to begin building the initial version of the interplanetary video-conferencing app. It is time to take a close look at software tools that we can use to manage our Agile Project. 

There are several tools available for Agile ALM (Application Lifecycle Management). For example, Jira, Azure DevOps, Trello, and others. Different companies and different teams use different tools.  Throughout your career you will have opportunity to have hands-on experience with several of them. 

Regardless of the ALM tool that you will use, it is important to keep track of the major Agile Methodology concepts. In this task, please read about the concepts below and complete a short quiz!

Complexity and Estimations

You should consider the following factors while estimating a user story:

Complexity: Consider the complexity of the story within the sprint
Risk: Consider the teamâ€™s inexperience with developing this story.
Implementation: Consider the implementation factors (UI, API, Services, Data Modelling etc.,)
Deployment: Consider the deployment requirements.
Interdependencies: Consider other outside issues.
Testing: Consider the possible scenarios

# Task 5 : Agile Curve Balls
For each scenario you need to (1) diagnose the problem, and (2) suggest a resolution. You should structure your answer like this:

Scenario 1:

Diagnosis: xx
Remedy: xx
